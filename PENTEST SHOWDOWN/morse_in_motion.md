1.  Watch the Video (or GIF)
    First, examine the provided morse_in_motion.gif or morse_in_motion.mp4.
    You’ll notice a blinking dot or light — sometimes quick, sometimes long.

    From the challenge description, we infer:

    Short blink (white on) = . (dot)

    Longer blink (white on for ~3x time) = - (dash)

    Black/off frames = separators between elements


2.  Extract Frames
    Use ffmpeg or Python to extract all frames for timing analysis


3.  Analyze Frame Durations

4.  Decode the Morse Code
