Corruption: noise, blocks, blur, contour, and contrast manipulation.
Solvers must clean up + decode QR + base64-decode to reach the flag.


Challenge: QR Unreadable MAX

Category: Misc

Difficulty: Medium

Points: 200

Description:
We recovered a QR code from a damaged surveillance feed, but it’s barely holding together. Noise, distortion, and corruption have made it unreadable to the naked eye.

Are you skilled enough to bring order to chaos? Restore the code. Decode its hidden message. Then decrypt the result.

Hint:
You may need to use image processing techniques — such as denoising, thresholding, or contrast adjustment — to clean up the QR before scanning.
Once scanned, don’t forget: the real message is Base64 encoded.
