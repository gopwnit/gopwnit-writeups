SOLUTION (maintainer only) - Echoes of the Keypress

Flag: flag{acoustic_side_channel}

Notes for maintainers:
- Mapping used (partial): see generator metadata in challenge package.
- Steps:
  1) Detect transient click events using an energy threshold or peak detection.
  2) For each click, compute FFT and find dominant frequency.
  3) Map each frequency to a character using nearest-match mapping.
  4) Reverse the middle segment before mapping (challenge has a reversed region).
  5) Reconstruct the flag string.
