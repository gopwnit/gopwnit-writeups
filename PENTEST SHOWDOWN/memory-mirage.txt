SOLUTION (maintainer only) - Memory Mirage

Flag: flag{memory_inception_achieved}

Steps:
1) Inspect dump.bin for ASCII strings; find 'User: agent_omega'.
2) Compute SHA1('agent_omega') and use the raw digest as a repeating XOR key.
3) Extract bytes between HIDDEN_REGION markers, XOR with key, then base64-decode result.
4) The decoded payload is the flag.
