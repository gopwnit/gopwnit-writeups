# 🕵️ Alpha Layer Truth - Solution Writeup

## Challenge Summary

The challenge provides a PNG image that looks perfectly normal when viewed casually. However, the flag is hidden not in the visible pixels, but in the **alpha channel** — the transparency layer of the image.

---

##  Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. **Initial Recon**
- Upon opening the image, nothing suspicious is immediately visible.
- Using `strings` or checking metadata reveals no hints.
- The hint or description may suggest: _"Look beyond what meets the eye"_ or _"Opacity hides the truth"_.

### 2. **Alpha Channel Inspection**
- Open the image in an advanced editor like **GIMP**, **Krita**, or **Photoshop**.
- Go to the **Channels** tab and isolate the **Alpha** channel.
- On zooming in, patterns may appear — possibly resembling binary digits or text-like structure.

### 3. **Programmatic Extraction**
- Use **Python with Pillow** or **OpenCV** to extract the alpha channel:
  - Load the image as RGBA.
  - Extract the 4th channel (alpha).
  - Convert the least significant bits (LSB) of each alpha value into binary.
  - Group bits into bytes and convert to ASCII.

### 4. **Rebuilding the Flag**
- After parsing the alpha channel’s LSBs, a binary string is revealed.
- Convert it to text using:
  - Group 8 bits at a time.
  - Convert each byte using `chr(int(byte, 2))`.
- Result: The flag in the format `flag{...}` appears.



## ✅ Final Flag
